# React TS Redux Toolkit

This is a **practical React and TypeScript project** that implements **Redux Toolkit** for efficient state management. It utilizes **dummy data** to simulate real-world use cases of managing global state with slices and selectors.  

## Features  

- **Redux Toolkit** for simplified and scalable state management  
- **Custom hooks (`useAppSelector`, `useAppDispatch`)** for cleaner Redux logic  
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability  
- **Dummy data** for testing state updates and reactivity  
- **React components** structured following modular principles
