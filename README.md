# RTK-SyncLab-02  

## Description  
RTK-SyncLab-02 is a testing lab built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Redux Toolkit**, designed to explore efficient state management patterns using **TypeScript**. This project allows hands-on experimentation with:

- Managing global state with Redux Toolkit  
- Using **custom hooks (`useAppSelector`, `useAppDispatch`)** for cleaner Redux logic  
- Ensuring type safety with TypeScript  
- Simulating real-world data handling through **dummy data**  
- Structuring React components using modular best practices  

It serves as a structured sandbox for understanding **Redux Toolkit with TypeScript** in scalable applications.

## Technologies Used  
- **React** – Frontend library for building UI components  
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development environment  
- **Redux Toolkit** – Standard approach for writing Redux logic  
- **React Redux** – Official bindings between React and Redux  
- **TypeScript** – Static type checking for maintainability  
- **CSS** – Simple styling for UI responsiveness
